### Microchip Insight on Things Desktop Application

### Introduction
[AWS IoT](http://aws.amazon.com/iot/) is a service that will allow Internet of Things (IoT) devices to be easily and securely connected to Amazon Web Services (AWS).  The __Insight on Things__ desktop application has been designed to work with this service via the shadow registers in AWS IoT to control Microchip's IoT demo.

Currently this demo is designed to work with the following demos:
- [Microchip IoT PIC32MZ based Demos Powered By AWS](https://github.com/MicrochipTech/aws-iot-firmware-pic32mz)

The quick start out of box guide for using the __Insight on Things__ desktop application can be found [here](docs/out-of-box-guide.md)
